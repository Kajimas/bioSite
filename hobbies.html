          <h2>Taking care of his dog</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Egge’s dog is a two-year-old male Spanish Water Dog named Argus. Argus was specifically picked out as a puppy because Spanish Water Dog do not shed, and Argus had the best temperament of his litter. A male SWD has an average height of 17.5 to 19.75 inches, a weight of 40 to 49 pounds, and a lifespan of 12 to 14 years.

          <h2>Exercise and the Keto diet</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Robert Egge’s workout routine contains several types of exercises,
            but the majority of them are body-weight training. Body-weight
            training exercises, as the name suggests, are exercises that use the
            practitioner’s weight as resistance to gain strength. Famous
            examples include pushups, planks, squats, situps, lunges, and
            pullups. One of the major benefits of body-weight training is that
            it requires no equipment an can be performed in most locations,
            though it is recommended that the practitioner does not over-exert
            themselves and that they maintain proper form.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Egge has been on a keto diet for several years now and mainly eats
            meat. A ketogenic dietis a high fat, low carb diet. While the diet
            is not for everyone, it drastically increases the body’s ability to
            process fats when it works. These fats are turned to ketones when
            they pass through the liver and are used as a brain-fuel alternative
            to sugars. As a result, blood sugar and insulin are significantly
            reduced.

          <br />
          <p>

Sanderson is the author of several well received fantasy series, including Mistborn andThe Stormlight Archives. Sanderson also has several games based on his works and offers free advice for beginning writers.
