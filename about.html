          <p>
            Robert Egge was born in the town of Everett in Washington state and
            lived there for the first four years of his life. From there he
            moved with his family to Pasadena, California, and then on to
            Westchester County, New York. After attending college and graduate
            school in Illinois, he began his career in Chicago as a political
            risk consultant.

          <br />

          <p>
            Soon, Egge’s career took him to Washington, D.C., where he worked on
            policy analysis and development. Over time, he focused more on
            government affairs with a focus on addressing different diseases.
            This led to him specializing on Alzheimer’s policy. Egge currently
            runs the public policy division of the Alzheimer’s Association where
            he leads the organization’s federal and state government affairs
            teams, the policy development team and the grassroots advocacy team.
            Egge has testified before Congress and serves as the organization’s
            spokesperson on policy issues.

          <p>
            In his free time, Egge spends most of his time recharging with his
            hobbies. The first of these hobbies is walking his Spanish Water
            Dog, Argus. The second is workouts that involve bodyweight
            exercises, slow walks, and cardio to maintain his strength and
            health. His final hobby involves reading espionage and military
            thrillers, in addition to epic fantasy.

          <p>
            In terms of food, Egge uses a low-carb, high-fat diet called a keto
            diet. This means that he will not eat sugary foods, like fruits,
            certain vegetables and berries unless they are in small quantities.
            I n exchange, fatty foods like butter, bacon, and stake are far
            healthier to eat than normal.
