          <p>
            Robert Egge is a public policy professional working to achieve a
            world without Alzheimer’s disease by encouraging U.S. federal and
            state governments to make addressing Alzheimer’s a top priority.

          <br />

          <p>
            Most of Mr. Egge’s work is centered in Washington, D.C., as he and
            his team work with the U.S. Congress and federal agencies. However,
            they also have staff and advocates in every state capital across the
            country striving to create better care and support for those with
            dementia through state policy advances as well.

          <p>
            Because his work consumes much of his focus and energy during the
            work week, in his personal life Mr. Egge most enjoys spending time
            with his family, and engaging in activities and a lifestyle that
            allows him to rest and recharge.
